# neuroevol

Notebooks are for exploration and prototyping. most up to date implementations are the in .py files

NEAT implementation with PyTorch. Using sklearn_digits as test ds.
implemenation is pretty slow. cant parallelize models once topologies are different

Next fgsm on the neat implementation
